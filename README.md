# Systolic-Array-2D-matrix-multiplication

This is a repo to implement the 2D matrix multiplication using systolic array architecture.

## Systolic Matrix Multiplication
Need to add the desciption of the systolic array architecture and how it is used to multiply two matrices.


## How to run the code

To generate the test benches you can run the following command:
```bash
$ make N=4
$ make N=8
```
This will generate and run the test benches for the NxN matrix multiplication, if the command did not show any errors then the test benches have passed.

In case of any errors, the command will show the following 
```bash
Error: result_matrix[0][0] = .. , expected = ..
```


## To Do
- [ ] Add the description of the systolic array architecture.
- [ ] Add the description of the code.
- [x] Add a makefile to run the code.
